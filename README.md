## (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS))
> __Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)__ is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell a browser to let a web application running at one origin (domain) 
  have permission to access selected resources from a server at a different origin. A web application executes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a 
  resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, and port) than its own origin.
